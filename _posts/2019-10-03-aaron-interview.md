This is an interview with Aaron Esau, a security [researcher](https://twitter.com/dc3vdp/status/1125483870902788100) in the [Department of Defense](https://hackerone.com/arinerron2) vulnerability disclosure program.

Q: Can our nukes get hacked? 

> The software systems in charge of our nuclear weapons are by design not exposed to the internet, meaning there is zero attack surface. The idea is simply ridiculous to anybody who knows anything about security.

Q: Is there a possibility of a physical security breach? 

> They have a lot of security measures in place to prevent attacks and accidents on the missiles. The communication line between the controller and the missiles is underground and there are cameras set up on poles to monitor. Physical security is highly enforced.

Q: What is the probability that our nukes get hacked within the next 50 years? 

> Way, way less than 1%.

Q: What do you think wars in the future will look like? 

> The world is becoming increasingly reliant on IOT. This trend elevates cyberspace to one of utmost importance. In the future, wars won't be fought on land or in the sky, but in the digital realm. Targetted US strikes can disable Russian flight computers, making physical conflict pointless. This also has the advantage of minimizing physical damage. Activities in cyberspace tend to deal with informational services only, minimizing the human cost of wars. Entire conflicts can be resolved with 0 human deaths. We need to prepare for this paradigm shift in warfare. As soon as 2030, conflicts will be transition primarily to the cyber realm. The US government must be ready for this cyber apocalypse, increasing funding towards cybersecurity.
